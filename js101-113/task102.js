// Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.

// Passed:You should be using a do...while loop for this exercise.
// Passed:myArray should equal [10].
// Passed:i should equal 11


// Setup
const myArray = [];
let i = 10;

// Only change code below this line
do{
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10)
