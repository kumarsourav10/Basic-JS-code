// Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects

// Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

// Waiting:You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.
// Waiting:You should use destructuring to create the highToday variable.
// Waiting:You should use destructuring to create the highTomorrow variable.
// Waiting:highToday should be equal to 77 and highTomorrow should be equal to 80.


// this is the code 
/*
   const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
   };
  
   // Only change code below this line
    
   const highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
   const highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow; 
  
   // Only change code above this line
