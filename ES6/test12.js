// Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

// Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.

// The value of a should be 6, after swapping.
// Waiting:The value of b should be 8, after swapping.
// Waiting:You should use array destructuring to swap a and b.

// this is the code 
// let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line

// this is the code ans.


let a = 8, b = 6;
// Only change code below this line
[a, b] = [b, a];
