// The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

// Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.

// The code should not contain a global myVar variable.
// You should add a local myVar variable.
