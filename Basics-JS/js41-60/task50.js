// Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
// Call the function with two numbers as arguments.

// Tests
// functionWithArgs should be a function.
// functionWithArgs(1,2) should output 3.
// functionWithArgs(7,9) should output 16.
// You should call functionWithArgs with two numbers after you define it.


function functionWithArgs(one, two) {
    console.log (one + two);
 }
